# DailyLedger

A simple web-based diary to record daily expenses and save them as a clean, formatted snapshot.

## Introduction 
This project is a browser-based Daily Budget Tracker designed to help users record their daily expenses in a diary-style layout. Users can enter expense names and amounts, automatically calculate the total expenditure, and save the filled diary page as an image. The interface is designed to look like a handwritten notebook while providing modern functionality such as auto-calculation, dynamic input handling, and screenshot generation.

## Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the web page     
CSS3 – Styling and layout (diary-style UI     
JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Logic, event handling, calculations     
html2canvas – Capturing and saving the diary page as an image

## The Process

- Design the diary-style UI using HTML and CSS     
- Implement input handling and total calculation using JavaScript     
- Add keyboard navigation for faster data entries     
- Dynamically manage expense rows     
- Integrate html2canvas to capture only relevant content     
- Optimize screenshot output by hiding unused elements temporarily    
- Refine layout so the diary page grows automatically with content

## What I Learned

1. Managing dynamic DOM elements using JavaScript    
2. Handling real-time calculations and user input events    
3. Improving user experience with keyboard navigation    
4. Using third-party libraries like html2canvas effectively    
5. Debugging layout issues caused by fixed heights and dynamic content   
6. Structuring code for better readability and maintainability
